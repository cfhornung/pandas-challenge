I have found that Charter Schools have better scores in Reading and in Math. They Also have a significantly higher passing rate. The overall passing rate at Charter Schools are %95.1 and District Schools are %73.68.

In addition, the smaller the school is, the better scores the students have and are passing at a higher percentage. 

What I thought was interesting was that as the spending per student went up, scores went down.
